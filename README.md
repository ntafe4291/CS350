# CS350
CS-350-T1196 Emerging Sys Arch &amp; Tech 22EW1
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The goal of the project was to develop a state machine to track user button press inputs, and to toggle between an "SOS" and an "OK" message.
What did you do particularly well?
The state machine was handled very well and efficiently, using switch/case statements and enumerations for state tracking in order to make sure that the status message was changed at the correct time, with minimal overhead
Where could you improve?
I am curious if there is a better way to do machine state tracking on a CS3220 besides a switch/case statement
What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I continue to develop familiarity with assembly language and uC development for embedded solutions
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
Machine state tracking is very common and is a skill that every developer should have. Continuing to develop better ways to perform machine state tracking will continue to payoff in the longterm
How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Comments in the code will make it very easy to understand what the code is doing, and in order to make changes in the future. It should be very clear for a user who is familiar with the CS3220 what is going on in this solution and to make changes if need be
